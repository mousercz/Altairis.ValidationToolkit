# Altairis Validation Toolkit

Set of various interesting .NET validation attributes, usable for examplein ASP.NET MVC and Web Forms model binding. You can use them to decorate model and ViewModel properties.

The library is compatible with .NET Framework 4.5 and above and .NET Standard 2.0.

## How to install

The best way to install this library is to use the `Altairis.ValidationToolkit` NuGet package.

## Validation attributes included

### DateOffsetAttribute
Validates if given `DateTime` falls within defined offset from current date. Useful for validating birthdates etc.

* `[DateOffset(-120, 0)]` - date must be between 120 years ago and `DateTime.Today`.
* `[DateOffset(null, "30.00.00.00")]` - date must be between `DateTime.Now` and `DateTime.Now` + 30 days.

*Please note:* By default, the attribute ignores time of day when comparing. If you want to take it in account, set `CompareTime` to `true` and modify error message formatting to show the time of day as well.

### GreaterThanAttribute
Validates if given value is greater than value of some other property.

* `[GreaterThan("Minimum")]` - value of this property must be greater than value of property `Minimum`.
* `[GreaterThan("Minimum", AllowEqual = true)]` - value of this property must be greater or equal to value of property `Minimum`.

### IcoAttribute
Validates if given string is valid IČO (*identification number of person*, the state-issued identifier used in Czech Republic).

* `[Ico]` - string must be valid IČO (no options are available)

### YearOffsetAttribute
Validates if given year (expressed as `int`) falls within defined offset from current year. Useful for validating birthdates etc.

* `[YearOffset(-120, 0)]` - year must be between from 120 years ago and current year.
* `[YearOffset(0, 10)]` - year must be in next 10 years from now.

### RequiredWhenAttribute
Makes property required when some other property has specific value.

* `[RequiredWhen("OtherProperty", "value")]` - property is required when `OtherProperty == "value"`.
* `[RequiredWhen("OtherProperty", "value", NegateCondition = true)]` - property is required when `OtherProperty != "value"`.

*Please note:* The default error message does not mention the master condition (it says *Field {0} is required*, not *Field {0} is required when some conditions are met*). It's recommended to override the message to be more specific to your model.

### RequiredEmptyWhenAttribute
Complements the `RequiredWhenAttribute`. Forces property to have `null` value when other property has specific value.

* `[RequiredEmptyWhen("OtherProperty", "value")]` - property is required to be empty when `OtherProperty == "value"`.
* `[RequiredEmptyWhen("OtherProperty", "value", NegateCondition = true)]` - property is required to be empty when `OtherProperty != "value"`.

*Please note:* The default error message does not mention the master condition (it says *Field {0} is required to be empty*, not *Field {0} is required to be empty when some conditions are met*). It's recommended to override the message to be more specific to your model.
